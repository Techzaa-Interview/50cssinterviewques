## List of Questions
1. **What is CSS?**
   - Answer: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.

2. **What are the different ways to include CSS in a webpage?**
   - Answer: CSS can be included in a webpage using three methods:
     - Inline CSS: Using the `style` attribute in HTML elements.
     - Internal CSS: Using the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
     - External CSS: Linking an external CSS file using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.

3. **What is the box model in CSS?**
   - Answer: The box model in CSS describes the design and layout of elements in a webpage. It consists of content, padding, border, and margin.

4. **What is the difference between `display: block`, `display: inline`, and `display: inline-block`?**
   - Answer: 
     - `display: block`: Renders an element as a block-level element, which takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
     - `display: inline`: Renders an element as an inline-level element, which does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
     - `display: inline-block`: Renders an element as an inline-level block container, allowing it to have block-level properties like width and height while remaining inline.

5. **What is the clearfix hack?**
   - Answer: The clearfix hack is a technique used to clear the floated children of a container. It ensures that the container expands to contain its floated children.

6. **What are pseudo-classes in CSS?**
   - Answer: Pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected elements. Some common pseudo-classes include `:hover`, `:active`, and `:focus`.

7. **What is the difference between `padding` and `margin` in CSS?**
   - Answer: 
     - `padding`: Specifies the space between the content and the border of an element.
     - `margin`: Specifies the space between the border of an element and adjacent elements.

8. **What is the CSS `z-index` property used for?**
   - Answer: The `z-index` property specifies the stacking order of elements that overlap. Elements with a higher `z-index` value are stacked above elements with a lower `z-index` value.

9. **What is the difference between `position: relative`, `position: absolute`, and `position: fixed`?**
   - Answer: 
     - `position: relative`: Positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow.
     - `position: absolute`: Positions an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor.
     - `position: fixed`: Positions an element relative to the viewport, so it remains fixed in its position even when the page is scrolled.

10. **What is CSS specificity and how does it work?**
    - Answer: CSS specificity is the mechanism by which browsers decide which CSS property values are applied to an element. It is based on the specificity of selectors used to target the element. Specificity is calculated using four values: inline styles, IDs, classes/attributes, and elements.
